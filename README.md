# BDDTest

## Example

`example.go` contains the following generate statement:
```
//go:generate go run ../gen.go
```
In the same package we have `example.story` which contains:
```
stories:
  - description: Dave gets a new guitar
    given: Dave caves in and buys another guitar
    when: his purchase is complete
    then: he is happy
    and:
      - he thinks that is definitely the last one
  - description: Daves cat chews his guitar cables
    given: the cat decides to chew through the guitar cable
    when: Dave sees this happening
    then: there is hell to pay
    and:
      - Dave yells loudly at the cat
      - the cat knows his days are numbered
```
Running `go generate` will generate the following test skeleton:
